### about

Clip-it is a Chrome extension that adds an icon to OpenAI's ChatGPT interface, allowing users to save specific question and response blocks to browser storage for later reference. It was built as a small, personal project to learn about browser extensions and APIs. The icon tab interface was built with Preact.
